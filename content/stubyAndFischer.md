  - projectDescription: From quilting to embroidery, clothing to works of art, this
      exhibition by six hands is a joyful exploration of textile techniques
      taking the viewer on a stroll through a pictorial staging of the pieces.
      The textile works, by the Charlotte Stuby and Susanne Fischer duo, invoke
      memories of mountains, the lake, and friendship. Sarah Margnetti’s brush
      makes the textile works dance in a ballet of hands, feet, and noses. The
      three artists connect with amusement and affinity between design and
      visual art to make light of these media as well as their status.

Knowing each other from the small town of Vevey in Switzerland, the paths of Charlotte Stuby and Susanne Fischer crossed again in Brussels after having both studied and worked in the art and textile field. 

A strong interest in each other’s craft was building up and we decided to make a trade. Inspired and stimulated by each other, our trade ended up becoming a never-ending collaboration. Working together since 2021, we enjoy exploring the paths between art and design. From embroidery to quilting, from clothes to pieces of art, our work is an investigation of craftsmanship with a design innovation twist.

This is a selection of collaborative works.
