Knowing each other from the small town of Vevey in Switzerland, the paths of Charlotte Stuby and Susanne Fischer crossed again in Brussels after having both studied and worked in the art and textile field. 

A strong interest in each otherâ€™s craft was building up and we decided to make a trade. Inspired and stimulated by each other, our trade ended up becoming a never-ending collaboration. Working together since 2021, we enjoy exploring the paths between art and design. From embroidery to quilting, from clothes to pieces of art, our work is an investigation of craftsmanship with a design innovation twist.

This is a selection of collaborative works.
