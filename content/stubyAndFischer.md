  - projectTitle: Take the opportunity to elevate yourself, 2024
    projectDescription: >-
      Two bar stools and a bar bench inspired by motocross attire


      Upcycled chairs garnished with fabric remnants from pevious projects. A continuous joyful exploration of various textile techniques such as embroidery, patchwork and piping, adapted to new structures. 


      Throughout this project, considering these weird and challenging times, our aim was to give people the opportunity to feel uplifted, not only by sitting higher but also through cheering embroidered messages.

      From quilting to embroidery, clothing to works of art, this exhibition by
      six hands is a joyful exploration of textile techniques taking the viewer
      on a stroll through a pictorial staging of the pieces. The textile works,
      by the Charlotte Stuby and Susanne Fischer duo, invoke memories of
      mountains, the lake, and friendship. Sarah Margnetti’s brush makes the
      textile works dance in a ballet of hands, feet, and noses. The three
      artists connect with amusement and affinity between design and visual art
      to make light of these media as well as their status.

Knowing each other from the small town of Vevey in Switzerland, the paths of Charlotte Stuby and Susanne Fischer crossed again in Brussels after having both studied and worked in the art and textile field. 

A strong interest in each other’s craft was building up and we decided to make a trade. Inspired and stimulated by each other, our trade ended up becoming a never-ending collaboration. Working together since 2021, we enjoy exploring the paths between art and design. From embroidery to quilting, from clothes to pieces of art, our work is an investigation of craftsmanship with a design innovation twist.

This is a selection of collaborative works.
