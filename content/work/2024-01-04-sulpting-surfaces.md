description: "


  Both artists have a unique approach to exploring and transforming materials.
  Charlotte uses fabric and threads as a medium for storytelling, while João
  transforms materials he finds into new realities. They breathe new life and
  meaning into the materials they work with, introducing new significance that
  transcends their typical properties and original purpose. By adding or
  removing layers and altering and shaping the texture, the artists achieve
  depth in their
  works.                                                                                                                                     \
