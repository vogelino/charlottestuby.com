  In a single physical place, this exhibition gathers spaces and events that by
  themselves would seem discordant, forming a dematerialized territory where
  escaping and inhabiting become permeable notions. A fragile area, where
  confusion is always possible, from where arises a fraction of a sensitive
  eagerness that allows to reveal the poetic strength of objects. By superposing
  our beliefs, by superposing the coincidences that we have noticed before, we
  want to recreate desire for contemplation.

  In order to escape of the temptation of a perpetual linear script, we are seeking to set a temporary order of things and to ceaselessly reexamine the way in which they interlink. L’Âge de Roseau is an invitation to roam the space of otherness, a place where imagination does not defy reality, a place where it is not its contrary or its opponent. Dream is a different reality: fertile and melancholic, it is the accomplice of all our memories. Pictures by Fabien Silvestre Suzor
