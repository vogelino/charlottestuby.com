description: From quilting to embroidery, clothing to works of art, this
  exhibition by six hands is a joyful exploration of textile techniques taking
  the viewer on a stroll through a pictorial staging of the pieces. The textile
  works, by the Charlotte Stuby and Susanne Fischer duo, invoke memories of
  mountains, the lake, and friendship. Sarah Margnettiâ€™s brush makes the textile
  works dance in a ballet of hands, feet, and noses. The three artists connect
  with amusement and affinity between design and visual art to make light of
  these media as well as their status. Pictures by Lola Pertsowsky
