title: '"Keepsake"'
subtitle: Kunsthal Gent, Ghent (BE), ongoing project since 2019
date: 2021-01-12T17:20:09.900Z
description: A 5 x 8 meters banner. For this installation, textile becomes a
  central element of the historical architecture of Kunsthal Gent. The mural
  hanging redefines the space by recomposing its chronology. "Keepsake" ties in
  with Kunsthal Gent's Endless Exhibition, in which works do not have a
  definitive place but can be moved or adapted in the future. The installation
  aims at involving inside and outside of the building, as a banner for the
  ever-changing future of Kunsthal Gent. Pictures by Michiel De Cleene
